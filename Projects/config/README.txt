### IMPORTANT ###:

This folder contains examples of configuration files used to access
your Wireless network and MQTT server.

DO NOT ENTER ANY (SENSITIVE) CONFIGURATION DATA INSIDE THIS DIRECTORY!!!

Instead copy the files to another (safe) location on your computer where they are excluded from source control 
to prevent them from being pushed to the Internet where they will be publicly available.
(The "example_" prefix should of course be removed.)

Only add the required configuration parameters in the files at that safe location.
(In projects using these configuration files, the paths will have to be adjusted.)
